# Image-Compression-
This is just starting code of deep learning with image compression . What i did is that from an image , firstly i converted the RGB image to a grayscale image . Then i split the matrix of image to according singular value decomposition , and then i did the best rank approximation . Firstly , i pick random first r = 5,10,100 singular values and plot them into picture and we've seen the image visualizable and understandable . Then i plot the singular values logarithm singular values vs r and we sured that we didn't need full set of singular values . Lastly , i also did cumulative plot the energy of how value is prioritized , mostly front part of the graph are valuable then the other rte of change is slow which we can neglect.
